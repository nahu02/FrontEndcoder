You can view your previous encodings in the "Encoding History" section, where you can also clear your history if needed.

## Running the API

This application relies on the **RestfulEncoders** API, which must be running for full functionality. You can find it here: [RestfulEncoders](https://github.com/nahu02/RestfulEncoders). Follow its README for setup instructions.
